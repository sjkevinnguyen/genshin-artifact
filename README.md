# genshin-artifact
This project is to determine the efficiency of obtaining genshin artifacts. Specifically, the project will focus on comparing the transmuter versus regular farming artifacts.

# Plan of Action
- Create Artifact class with correct attributes 
- Create rules for generating random valid substats
- Simulate leveling artifacts
- Randomly roll into sub stats according to Genshin's rules
- Need information on artifacts per max domain run
- Artifacts without crit rate and crit damage in the 
- Efficiency will be related to artifact experience
- Will do tests on unlimited santifying elixirs vs leveling santifying elixirs
